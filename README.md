# P170M105 Virtual Reality Modeling

## Lab Work

### Lab 1

In this lab, you will have to set up your Git repository and your project and add some models to your virtual scene.

#### Task

Choose an environment and create a virtual scene of it in Godot or another game engine.
The environment can be a room in your house, an office, a small outdoor scene.
You can use third-party models (from Sketchfab, CGTrader, or anywhere else) and models that you create yourself.

Requirements:
* The environment’s project is in a hosted repository.
* The environment consists of at least **10 models**.
* The models have to be listed in a text file in the repository (the name and the link from where it’s been downloaded).
* Have textured materials.
* Have collisions that meet the object’s shape.

#### Notes

* The project lives in **./virtual_env directory**
* Model sources:
